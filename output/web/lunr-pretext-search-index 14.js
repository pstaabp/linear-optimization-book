The car is made with 6 units of pine, 3 units of birch and take a total of 45 minutes to make. The SUV is made with 5 units of pine, 6 units of birch and takes a total of 75 minutes to make. The truck takes 4 units of pine, 7 units of birch and takes a total of 90 minutes to make. For each car he make $10 in profit, for each SUV is $15 in project and for each truck is $12 in profit.  Luis take a look at his shop on a Monday and has ?? units of pine, ?? units of birch. For the week, he has a total of 30 hours of time he can spend in the shop. How many of each toy should he make to maximize his profit?   Consider the set of inequalities:        Graph the set of points that satisfy all 4 inequalities.    Find the maximum of the function on this set.    Where does the maximum occur?        hi   "

  "title": "Slack Variables and Dictionaries",
  "body": " Slack Variables and Dictionaries   In , we examined feasible sets using geometry. As we saw in that section, solutions occur on the boundary of the feasible set,    Slack Variables  Letâ€™s return to the LOP found at the beginning of the section, that is maximize  subject to     Another way to look at this problem is to introduce slack variables to the first three inequalities that will convert the inequality to an equation. If we introduce and in the following way:     and and must be nonnegative in order for the above inequalities to remain true. Solving these three equations for and , we can write the LOP as     This is called the dictionary form of the LOP. Note that the variables on the left of the equals signs are only and . These are called the nonbasic variables or parameters of the problem. These are the original variables. The four variables on the left side are are called the basic variables and the set of these are called the basis of the problem. These are the objective and slack variables.  Note also, that when and are 0, these are the 5 lines that define the feasible set.  The basic variables and nonbasic are often distinguished from one another using the variables and respectively. For example, in the dictionary above, and .  A plot of the feasible set listed in the dictionary form in is        In this form, it is easy to see that the boundaries of the feasible set occur when either the slack variables or the original variables are zero. Note that the original variables are zero on the coordinate axes. You can also notice that the vertices of the feasible set occur where two of the variables are zero. Note that there are 5 of these. Also, there are other intersection points between lines where the variables are 0, 4 of these are not within the feasible set.  Recall that from the previous chapter, that the optimal point occurs on one of the vertices of the feasible set. We will see here in this chapter how to walk from vertex to vertex not leaving the feasible set and also stopping when reaching the maximum of the objective.    Tableaus  Another way to look at these algebraic equations are in a matrix form, generally called a tableau . Rewrite all of the equations with the variables on the left side and the constant on the right to get the following standard augmented coefficient matrix:     The first two columns are the variables and , the original variables, the next block of four columns are and and the last column is the -column of right hand sides. Also, the last row is the objective row.  A solution to either the dictionary or the tableau is any set of values for that satisfy the problem constraints written as equalities. For example, is a solution to the LOP above. The value of that would correspond to this solution is .  A solution is basic if the parameters or nonbasic variables are all zero. In the LOP problem above, the solution is basic with value .  A dictionary or tableau is feasible if its corresponding basic solution is feasible. Both and are feasible solutions, whereas is not because and does not satisfy the nonnegative constraint.  We are now going to develop the Simplex Method to solving the LOP using either the dictionary or the tableau. If either the dictionary or tableau is infeasible, then we saw that we are in Phase I of the simplex method, otherwise we are in Phase II .  Lastly, the tableau or dictionary is optimal if its basic solution is optimal. The simplex method will stop when we reach an optimal solution.   "
