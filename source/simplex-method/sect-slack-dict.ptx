  <title>Slack Variables and Dictionaries</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In <xref ref="sect-geometry" />, we examined feasible sets using geometry. As we saw in that
      section, solutions occur on the boundary of the feasible set, </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Slack Variables</title>

    <p> Letâ€™s return to the LOP found at the beginning of the section, that is <em>maximize</em> <m>z= f(x_1,x_2)=x_1+3x_2</m> subject to </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>4x_1 + 3x_2 \amp \leq 120, </mrow>
        <mrow>x_1 + 2x_2 \amp \leq 40,</mrow>
        <mrow>x_2 \amp \leq 16,</mrow>
        <mrow>x_1, x_2 \amp \geq 0.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p> Another way to look at this problem is to introduce <term>slack variables</term> to the
      first three inequalities that will convert the inequality to an equation. If we introduce <m>x_3,
      x_4</m> and <m>x_5</m> in the following way: </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>4x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 \amp = 120</mrow>
        <mrow>x_1 + 2x_2 + x_4 \amp = 40</mrow>
        <mrow>x_2 + x_5 \amp = 16 </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p> and <m>x_3, x_4</m> and <m>x_5</m> must be nonnegative in order for the above inequalities
      to remain true. Solving these three equations for <m>x_3, x_4</m> and <m>x_5</m>, we can write
      the LOP as </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{Max.}\; z \amp = x_1 + 3x_2 </mrow>
        <mrow>\text{s.t.}\quad x_3 \amp = 120 - 4 x_1 -3x_2 </mrow>
        <mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq-dict-LOP1"> x_4 \amp = 40 - x_1 - 2x_2</mrow>
        <mrow>x_5 \amp = 16 - x_2 </mrow>
        <mrow>\text{and}\; x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \amp \geq 0</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p> This is called the <term>dictionary</term> form of the LOP. Note that the variables on the
      right of the equals signs are only <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>. These are called the <term>nonbasic
      variables</term> or <term>parameters</term> of the problem. These are the original variables.
      The four variables on the left side are <m>z, x_3, x_4, x_5</m>. The three <m>x</m> variables
      are called the <term>basic variables</term> and the set of these are called the <term>basis</term>
      of the problem. For this example, these are the objective and slack variables, however as we
      update the dictionary, these will change. </p>

    <p> Note also, that when <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4</m> and <m>x_5</m> are 0, these are the 5 lines
      that define the feasible set. </p>

    <p> The <term>basic</term> variables and <term>nonbasic</term> are often distinguished from one
      another using the variables <m>\beta</m> and <m>\pi</m> respectively. For example, in the
      dictionary above, <m>\beta=\{3,4,5\}</m> and <m>\pi=\{1,2\}</m>. </p>

    <p>
      In this form, it is easy to see that the boundaries of the feasible set occur when either the
      slack variables or the original variables are zero. Note that the original variables are zero
      on the coordinate axes.
      You can also notice that the vertices of the feasible set occur where two of the variables are
      zero. Note that there are 5 of these. Also, there are other intersection points between lines
      where the variables are 0, 4 of these are not within the feasible set.
</p>

    <p>
      Recall that from the previous chapter, that the optimal point occurs on one of the vertices of
      the feasible set. We will see here in this chapter how to walk from vertex to vertex not
      leaving the feasible set and also stopping when reaching the maximum of the objective.

  <subsection xml:id="sect-basic-solutions">
    <title>Basic Solutions</title>

    <p> A <term>solution</term> to either the dictionary or the tableau is any set of values for <m>
      \boldsymbol{x}</m> that satisfy the problem constraints written as equalities. For example, <m>\boldsymbol{x}=(10~
      5 ~|~ 65~20~11)^{\intercal}</m> is a solution to the LOP above. This is because if we
      substitute these values of <m>\boldsymbol{x}</m> and <m>z</m>, then each line of the
      dictionary is satisfied. </p>

    <p> For example, plugging these into the dictionary is <md>
        <mrow>x_3 \amp = 120 - 4(10) - 3(5) = 65 </mrow>
        <mrow>x_4 \amp = 40 - 10 - 2(5) = 20</mrow>
        <mrow>x_5 \amp = 16 - 5 = 11</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>The value of <m>z</m> that corresponds to is solution is <m>z=x_1+3x_2 = 10 + 3(5) = 25</m>. </p>

    <note>
      <p> The term <em>solution</em> is not a (or the) solution to the LOP, that is this may not be
        a value that is the optimum value of the function. We use the term solution here as a
        indication that a point satisfies all of the equations. </p>
    </note>
    <p> A solution is <term>basic</term> if the parameters or <term>nonbasic variables</term> are
      all zero. In the LOP problem above, the solution <m>
      \boldsymbol{x}=(0~0~|~120~40~16)^{\intercal}</m> is basic with value <m>z=0</m>. If we have a
      problem in dictionary form, we will set the basic variables to 0 and the parameters will be
      constants on right side of the equations. </p>

    <p> In the example where <m>x_1 =0</m> and <m>x_2=0</m> is a basic solution with the basis <m>\beta
      = \{1,2\}</m>. Recall that we mention above that when two variables (in this case, not in
      general) are zero, then we are at a vertex of the feasible set. This vertex is at the origin. </p>

    <p> A dictionary or tableau is <term>feasible</term> if its corresponding basic solution is
      feasible. Both <m>\boldsymbol{x}=(10~ 5 ~|~ 65~20~11)^{\intercal}</m> and <m>
      \boldsymbol{x}=(0~0~|~120~40~16)^{\intercal}</m> are feasible solutions, whereas <m>
      \boldsymbol{x}=(0~30~|~30~-20~-14)^{\intercal}</m> is not because <m>x_4=-20</m> and <m>
      x_5=-14</m> does not satisfy the nonnegative constraint. </p>

    <p> We are now going to develop the <term>Simplex Method</term> to solve the LOP using the
      dictionary. This technique will be systematically going from vertex to vertex of the feasible
      set until the optimal solution is reached.<fn>This is perhaps a bit too simplistic, because as
      we will see that the starting basis may not be in the feasible set and we need to get there
      first.</fn>
    </p>

    <p> Lastly, the dictionary is <term>optimal</term> if its basic solution is optimal. The simplex
      method will stop when we reach an optimal solution. </p>

  <subsection xml:id="sect-develop-simplex">
    <title>Developing the Simplex Method</title>

    <p> If we return to the dictionary in <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1" />, we notice that if either <m>
      x_1</m> or <m>x_2</m> increases in value then <m>z</m> increases and since we are seeking a
      maximum of <m>z</m>, this is desirable, so we want to increase either <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>
      or both. We must be careful however, because as <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> increases, <m>x_3,
      x_4</m> and <m>x_5</m> decrease and they must stay nonnegative. Before increasing these
      variables, recall that the basis is <m>\beta=\{1,2\}</m> indicating that these two variables
      are in the basis (recall that the basic variables are the ones on the right side of all of the
      equations in a dictionary). The variable <m>x_1</m> will be increased, so will set <m>x_2=0</m>
      in <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1" />: </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow> z\amp= x_1,</mrow>
        <mrow> x_3\amp= 120-4x_1 </mrow>
        <mrow> x_4\amp= 40 -x_1, </mrow>
        <mrow> x_5\amp= 16. </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>


    <p> If we increase <m>x_1</m>, and keep <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m> nonnegative, we require that </p>
    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>120 -4x_1\amp\geq 0,\amp40-x_1\amp\geq 0.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p> The largest value of <m>x_1</m> that ensure both of these stay true is <m>x_1=30</m>. If we
      let <m>x_1=30</m> in <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1" />, notice that when <m>x_2=0,</m> the variable <m>
      x_3</m> becomes zero, therefore it appears that we have interchanged <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m>
      between basic and nonbasic variables. Thus the new basis is <m>\beta=\{1,4,5\}</m> and the
      parameters is <m>\pi = \{2,3\}</m>. This switch of variables is called a <term>pivot</term>
      and is denoted <m>1 \mapsto 3</m>, where the first number 1 is the variable entering the basis
      and the second number is the one leaving. </p>

    <p> If we want <m>x_3</m> to be in the basis and <m>x_1</m> to leave we use the 2nd equation in
      the dictionary in <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1" /> and solve for <m>x_1</m> or </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        x_1= 30 -\frac{1}{4}x_3 - \frac{3}{4}x_2.
</me>
    </p>

    <p> To get <m>x_3</m> a basic variable for the rest of the dictionary, we plug this in the other
      equations in <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1" />, resulting in the new dictionary: </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>z\amp= 30+\frac{9}{4}x_2 - \frac{1}{4}x_3 </mrow>
        <mrow> x_1\amp= 30 - \frac{3}{4}x_2 - \frac{1}{4}x_3 </mrow>
        <mrow> x_4\amp= 10-\frac{5}{4}x_2 +\frac{1}{4}x_3</mrow>
        <mrow> x_5\amp= 16-x_2 </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      which is a bit annoying with the fractions, so multiplying each row each by 4 to get:
</p>
    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow> 4z\amp= 120 +9x_2-x_3</mrow>
        <mrow> 4x_1\amp=120 -3x_2-x_3 </mrow>
        <mrow> 4x_4\amp= 40 -5x_2+x_3</mrow>
        <mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq-dict-LOP1-step2"> 4x_5\amp= 64-4x_2.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      (Note: there was no reason to multiply the last row by 4, but you will see later why we want
      to do this.)
</p>

    <p> Also, we have a new basic solution for the dictionary in <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1-step2" />
      as <m>\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}=(120~0~|~0~40~64)^{\intercal}/4=(30~0~|~0~10~16)^{\intercal}</m>.
      where the superscript <m>(1)</m> denotes the first step of the simplex method. Also, this
      dictionary corresponds to the basis of <m>\beta=\{1,4,5\}</m> and parameters <m>\pi=\{2,3\}</m>.
      The notation <m>1 \mapsto 3</m> shows that 1 has left the <m>\pi</m> set (nonbasic) to become
      a basic variable replacing 3. </p>

    <p> The objective in the first row of <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1-step2" /> is <m>z = 120/4=30</m>,
      shows first that it has increased from the initial dictionary, but also that if we increase <m>
      x_2</m>, then <m>z</m> will increase. Because of this, we also know that the current solution
      is not optimal. We can increase <m>x_2</m> so long that it satisfies: </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>120-3x_2\amp\geq 0,\amp 40-5x_2\amp\geq 0,\amp64-4x_2\amp\geq 0. </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      This occurs by selecting
</p>
    <p>
      <me>
        x_2= \min(120/3=40, 40/5=8,64/4=16) = 8
</me>
    </p>

    <p> Because the 8 came from the the 3rd equation of <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1-step2" />, we are
      going to solve for <m>x_2</m> (or actually <m>5x_2</m>) in this equation or </p>

    <p>
      <men xml:id="eq-dict-LOP1-x2">
        5 x_2 = 40 + x_3 - 4x_4
      </men>
    </p>

    <p> We now take the other three equations in <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1-step2" /> and multiply by 5
      because of the coefficient of the variable <m>x_2</m> above to get: </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>20 z \amp = 600 + 9 (5x_2) - 5 x_3 </mrow>
        <mrow>20 x_1 \amp = 600 - 3 (5x_2) - 5 x_3</mrow>

        <mrow>20 x_5 \amp =320 - 4 (5 x_2)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p> and then in each of the terms in the parentheses substitute <xref ref="eq-dict-LOP1-x2" />,
      to get </p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow> 20 z \amp = 600 + 9 (40 + x_3-4x_4) - 5 x_3 = 960 + 4x_3 - 36 x_4 </mrow>
        <mrow>20 x_1 \amp = 600 - 3 (40 + x_3-4x_4) - 5 x_3 = 480 - 8x_3 + 12 x_4</mrow>

        <mrow>20 x_5 \amp =320 - 4 (40 + x_3-4x_4) = 160 - 4x_3 + 16 x_4</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we note that each of the first, second and fourth equations above are factors of 4 (the
      previous coefficient of all parameters), if we divide these three equations by 4 to get:
</p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>5 z \amp = 240 + x_3 - 9 x_4 </mrow>
        <mrow>5 x_1 \amp = 120 - 2x_3 + 3 x_4</mrow>

        <mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq-dict-LOP1-step3">5 x_5 \amp = 40 - x_3 + 4 x_4</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p> which is the current dictionary. Note that 4 is now a basic variable and 2 is now a
      parameter. This means that we have done the pivot: <m>2\mapsto 4</m> and the basis is <m>\beta
      = \{3,4\}</m> and parameter is <m>\pi = \{1,2,5\}</m>. The basic solution of this dictionary
      or tableau is <m>\boldsymbol{x}=(120~40~|~0~0~40)^{\intercal}/5=(24~8~|~0~0~8)^{\intercal}</m>
      with objective function value <m>z=240/5=48</m>. </p>

    <p> If we look at the dictionary, the top row is <m>5z=240+x_3-9x_4</m>. If we increase the
      variable <m>x_3</m>, then the objective function will be increased. We will increase <m>x_3</m>,
      but in order to ensure that we remain in the feasible set, we required that </p>

    <p>

        <mrow>120-2x_3\amp\geq 0,\amp40+x_3\amp\geq 0,\amp40-x_3\amp\geq 0.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p> We wish to increase <m>x_3</m> by the maximum amount with these constraints and this occurs
      when </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        x_3 = \min(120/2=60,40/1=40) = 40
</me>
    </p>

    <p> where the second inequality has been ignored because it is automatically satisfied for any
      positive value of <m>x_3</m>. Since the minimum value is associated with the 4th equation, we
      will solve for <m>x_3</m> in this equation or </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        x_3 = 40 + 4x_4 - 5 x_5
</me>
    </p>

    <p>We then substitute this into the other equations or </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p> The basic solution of this tableau is <m>\boldsymbol{x}=(40~80~|~200~0~0)^{\intercal}/5\\
      =(8~16~|~40~0~0)^{\intercal}</m> with the objective function taking on the value <m>z=56</m>.
      Lastly, looking at the objective equation, increasing our basic variables <m>x_4</m> or <m>x_5</m>
      decreases the objective value, so this means that this solution is <em>optimal.</em>
    </p>

    <p>In the next section, we repeat this example with a matrix form of the dictionary, called a
      tableau. This will make all of the calculation easier to do and with some software can
      simplify the steps tremendously. </p>
