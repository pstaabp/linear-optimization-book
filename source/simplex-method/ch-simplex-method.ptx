  <title>The Simplex Method</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Some of problems in <xref ref="ch-linear-models"/> were simple enough that with some geometric arguments, we can determine the solution.  However, plotting regions above 3 dimensions is impossible and as the number of variables and contraints increase, problems get far too complex to rely on geometric arguments to ensure we have the correct solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here we introduce the <term>simplex method</term>, by far the most robust and efficient way of solving these problems.  We will we see that for <em>standard maximum problems</em> that the simplex method is straightfoward but for problems not in this form, there are techniques that adapt the standrad simplex method for such problems.
