  <title>Simplex Method for Infeasible Tableaus</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Consider <xref ref="prob-coffee" />, in which coffee is shipped from warehouses to retail
      outlets. The problem was set up as an LOP in<xref ref="prob-coeff-setup" /> and we can use the
      techniques from the previous section to write this as the following tableau. </p>

    <p>
      First, as discuss in ???, we need to write this problem in standard form, which means
      switching two of the inequalites by negating them. Also, the objective needs to be written as
      a maximum. The LOP in standard maximum form is
</p>

    <p>
      <men xml:id="eq-coffee-std-form">
        \begin{aligned}\text{Minimize} \amp \amp
        z \amp = -2.5 x_1 - 3 x_2 - 4 x_3 - 2 x_4, \\
        \text{subject to} \amp \amp -x_2 - x_3 \amp \leq -400.\\
        \amp \amp -x_1 - x_4 \amp \leq -350, \\
        \amp \amp x_1 + x_2 \amp \leq 700, \\
        \amp \amp x_3 + x_4 \amp \leq 500, \\
        \amp \amp x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \amp \geq 0.
        \end{aligned}
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      And the next step is to write the LOP in tableau form,
</p>

    <p>
      <men xml:id="eq-coffee-init-tableau">
        \left[\begin{array}{rrrr|rrrrr|r}
        0 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -400\\
        -1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -350\\
        1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 700\\
        0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 500\\ \hline
        5/2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0\\
        \end{array} \right]
      </men>

    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, we look at the objective row to determine if a tableau is optimal and the there are
      no negatives in this row, so it appears it is optimal. However, if we look at the basic
      solution of</p>
    <p>
      <me>
        \boldsymbol{x} = \left[ \begin{array} {rrrr|rrrrr}
        -400 \amp -350 \amp 700 \amp 500 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
        \end{array} \right]^{\intercal}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      and note that this is an infeasible basic solution. Before solvnig this problem, let's use a
      smaller problem to develop the simplex method for this situation.

    <title>Infeasible Tableaus</title>

    <p>
      We saw an LOP of a transportation problem above. Before solving that, let's look at a simpler
      one that only has two variables and two constraints:
</p>

    <problem xml:id="prob-infeasible1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the following LOP:
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}
            \text{Minimize} \amp \amp w \amp = 3x_1 + 2x_2 \\
            \text{Subject to}\amp \amp 3x_1 + x_2 \amp \geq 17 \\
            \amp \amp x_1 + 2x_2 \amp \geq 9 \\
            \amp \amp x_1, x_2 \amp \geq 0
            \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      To begin with, this is not in standard form, so we perform some algebra (as in section ???) to
      get this into standard form:
</p>

    <p>
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        \text{Maximize} \amp \amp z \amp = -3x_1 - 2x_2 \\
        \text{Subject to}\amp \amp - 3x_1 - x_2 \amp \leq -17 \\
        \amp \amp -x_1 - 2x_2 \amp \geq -9 \\
        \amp \amp x_1, x_2 \amp \geq 0
        \end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this only has two variables, a plot of this feasible set is helpful.

      If we introduce slack variables then in Dictionary form this is

    <p> As we saw in <xref ref="eq-coffee-std-form" /> and <xref ref="eq-coffee-init-tableau" />,
      that this tableau is infeasible. That is the basic solution is not feasible which makes sense
      because when the basic variables are the original variables, the current basic solution is at
      the origin, which is not in the feasible set. </p>
    <p> As in the Phase II simplex method, we can perform a pivot. The dictionary in <xref
        ref="eq-dict-infeasible-LOP1" /> shows that the basis is <m>\beta = \{1,2\}</m> and
      parameters <m>\pi = \{3,4\}.</m> We will remove <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> from the basis and
      thus have two choices to bring in either <m>x_3</m> or <m>x_4</m>. There are four cases here.
      Let's see what happens with each. </p>

          <title>
            <m>3 \mapsto 1</m>
          </title>
          <p> Let's try by bringing <m>x_1</m> out of the basis. If we solve the 2nd equation in <xref
              ref="eq-dict-infeasible-LOP1" /> for <m>x_1</m> (or actually <m>3x_1</m>) we get </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            and then substituting this into the other equations (and multiplying through by a 4)
            gives the new dictionary

    <p> We compare what happened here. The cases <m>4 \mapsto1</m> and <m>3 \mapsto 2</m> resulted
      in feasible solutions, whereas the other two did not. </p>

    <p> This can be explained looking at the feasible set in <xref ref="fig-infeasible-1" />. Again,
      the initial dictionary has a basic solution of <m>x_1=0, x_2=0</m>, which is at the origin.
      The pivot <m>3 \mapsto 1</m> shifts the basic solution to the point <m>A</m> because this is
      the <m>x_3=0</m> line. Alternatively, the pivot <m>4 \mapsto 1</m> shifts the basic solution
      to point <m>B</m>, which is in the feasible set. The pivot <m>3 \mapsto 2</m> shifts the basic
      solution to the point <m>E</m> (the intersection of the lines <m>x_2=0</m> and <m>x_3=0</m>).
      The pivot <m>4 \mapsto 2</m> shifts the basic soltuion to point <m>D</m>, which is not
      feasible. </p>
    <p> So we need to determine from the dictionary (or more likely from the tableau) how to
      determine which pivot will make it feasible. In this case, it seems like either <m>4 \mapsto 1</m>
      or <m>3 \mapsto 2</m> would be a good step. </p>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>

    <p> Let's solve <xref ref="prob-infeasible1" /> using <xref ref="alg-phaseI-simplex" />. First,
      write the tableau down (recall that the standard form of the problem needs to be used.) </p>

    <p>
      <me>\left[\begin{array}{rr|rrr|r}

        \end{array} \right]
      </me>
    </p>

    <p> And to start phase I, we note that the largest negative in the <m>\boldsymbol{b}</m>-column
      is in the first row. We then do ratios of <m>b_i</m> to all of the negatives in the row. This
      occurs in column two (the ratio is <m>-17/(-1)=17</m>). Thus, the matrix pivot is row 1,
      column 2: </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        3 \mapsto 2 \qquad \left[\begin{array}{rr|rrr|r}

        5 \amp 0 \amp -2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 25\\ \hline
        -3 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp -34\\
        \end{array} \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p> Note that this tableau is no longer infeasible (there's no negatives in the last column,
      except for <m>z</m>). We can now switch to phase II. </p>

    <p> For phase II, we need to check for optimality, but since there is a negative in the bottow
      row, it is not optimal, so we form the <m>\boldsymbol{b}</m>-ratios: </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        \begin{bmatrix} 17/3 \\ 25/5 \end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix} 5.667 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>and therefore the smallest <m>\boldsymbol{b}</m>-ratio is in the 2nd row, so perform the
      matrix pivot about row 2, column 1</p>

      <me>
